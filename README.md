# Laboratory Barbershop

This was a project for a local barbershop I've been going to for a while! This website is made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and most of the styling was done using Bootstrap's library. A responsive website for people who are interested in his business to go and learn more about Laboratory barbershop, find out where to schedule an appointment, and overall get a feel for this wonderful business!
